This repository is a **public mirror** intended for transparency with grant reviewers and the community.
It includes only non-sensitive documentation and example files.

- No production credentials, private keys, or personal data are present.
- Core implementation (AI scoring logic, infrastructure, configurations) is kept **private** to protect users and prevent abuse.
- We can provide restricted access to the full source code **upon request under NDA** for formal security review.
