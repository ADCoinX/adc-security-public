# ADC Validator Suite (Public Overview)

**Security-first Web3 validation tools**  
This is a public mirror repository for grant reviewers and the community.  
It contains non-sensitive documentation and example files only.  
Core implementation, API keys, and infrastructure details are kept private for security reasons.

## 🛡 Security-first Design
- **Stateless**: No PII stored; all processing done in-memory.
- **Aggregate Logging Only**: Counts & metrics, no wallet addresses or IPs.
- **Multi-layer Security**:
  - TLS enforced
  - Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)
  - CORS allowlist
  - Rate limiting + WAF
